In this app the user inputs the name of a city and the current weather information of it is displayed. The data used in this page is retrieved from the open weather api. The goal of doing this project was to practice how to write asynchronous code in JS with promises and the async/await syntax, and also learning and getting an idea of how to work with APIs and the fetch function.
